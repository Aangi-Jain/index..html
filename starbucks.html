<h1 style="text-align:center"> Our coffee</h1>



<p style="color:blue;font-size:40px"face="cooper"> We go where the best beans are: </p>

<p style="font-family: Verdana">The best beans grow at higher altitudes. The cold nights and warm days create denser beans. 
And denser beans have deeper, more complex flavours. Taste them in every cup of Starbucks coffee.
</p>

<p style="color:blue;font-size:40px"face="cooper">
Weâ€™re for the good of all coffee </p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana">So if we can help a farmer grow better beans, we will. 
Any farmer, anywhere. To that end, we have farmer support centres on four continents 
where our agronomists test soils, examine samples and provide advice, free, to any coffee farmer who asks.</p>

<p style="color:blue;font-size:40px"face="cooper">
We nurture deep-rooted relationships </p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana">The future of coffee is entwined with the future of coffee farmers. 
So we nurture those relationships the same way they nurture their beans. 
We work to get farmers a fair price and to make sure everyone in the 
community can benefit from the coffee industry. 
It leads to better livelihoods for farmers, 
and a better cup of coffee for all of us.</p>
